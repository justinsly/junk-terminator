# junk terminator
 tries to close background processes that might affect your performance.
originally made as a personal project for my own benefits
## the termination
junk terminator will try to close useless background tasks such as background phone link processes, microsoft compatibality telemary, and more to come. it also gives an option to close firefox (as its my main browser and it sometimes starts background tasks that takes alot of disk power lol)



### TO-DO:
- figure out how to make the code run as administrator
- add more junk and optional processes to terminate
