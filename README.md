![junk terminator](pictures/title.png)

 Tries to close background processes that might affect your performance.
Originally made as a personal project for my own benefits

# required stuff
the whole thing is made up out of a .py file, so you need to have python installed on your computer


# The termination
Junk terminator will try to close useless background tasks such as background Phone Link processes, Microsoft Compatibality Telemary, and more to come.



### TO-DO:
- [x] ~~figure out how to make the code run as administrator~~ done at commit [218640c](https://github.com/justinsly/junk-terminator/commit/218640c8ce726829f91fa207fc68769bb8d513c1)
- [ ] add more junk and optional processes to terminate
