![junk terminator](pictures/extratitle.png)

### note
this version of JT is planned to contain more features. for a more lightweight version, check out the [main branch of the project](https://github.com/justinsly/junk-terminator/tree/main)

# description
Tries to close background processes that might affect your performance.
Originally made as a personal project for my own benefits

# required stuff
the whole thing is made up out of a .py file, so you need to have python installed on your computer


# The termination
Junk terminator will try to close useless background tasks such as background Phone Link processes, Microsoft Compatibality Telemary, and more to come.



### TO-DO:
- figure out how to make the code run as administrator (kinda getting there???)
- add more junk and optional processes to terminate
