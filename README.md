![junk terminator](pictures/title.png)

 Tries to close background processes that might affect your performance.
Originally made as a personal project for my own benefits

## The termination
Junk terminator will try to close useless background tasks such as background Phone Link processes, Microsoft Compatibality Telemary, and more to come.



### TO-DO:
- figure out how to make the code run as administrator (kinda getting there???)
- add more junk and optional processes to terminate
